** What is sysinfo function?
=sysinfo()= originally is a GNU libc function, used to retrieve
various system information.

** Why it's needed on FreeBSD?
It was created to make it easier to port GNU/Linux applications
on FreeBSD by Kostas Petrikas. The original source of libsysinfo
is now archived [[https://code.google.com/archive/p/sysinfo-bsd/][here]] ([[https://web.archive.org/web/20231223182848/https://code.google.com/archive/p/sysinfo-bsd/][archived]]).

** What is libsysinfo2?
It's libsysinfo version 2. I've removed some ancient code, gave
some cleanup, and improved error handling.

** Examples
See the =test= folder.
